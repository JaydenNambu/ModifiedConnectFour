# ModifiedConnectFour
A playable modified connect four game, with an AI controlled opponent. The differences between this version and connect four is that the board can be varied in size, pieces, including obstacle pieces, may be placed before the game begins, and the game only ends once the board is full. The score is calculated by summing the total points generated by all runs of three or greater length, each run of n length counts as n squared points, i.e. a three length run is worth nine points. 

The AI has various settings, including minimax, minimax with a heuristic past a settable depth limit, and alpha-beta pruning.
The size of the board and AI setting is controoled by command line arguments.
